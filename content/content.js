      "Our research group is dedicated to harnessing genomics to improve human health. We leverage large-scale genomic and phenotypic datasets from population biobanks and disease-specific patient cohorts to develop genomics-informed approaches for disease diagnosis, prevention, risk prediction, and therapeutic stratification. Our research spans a broad spectrum of complex diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and immune disorders.",
      "We aim to investigate the full spectrum of human genetic variation using bioinformatics and statistical genetics methodologies to uncover the molecular basis of disease susceptibility and clinical heterogeneity. By integrating population-scale genomic data with deep phenotypic information, we aim to identify clinically relevant genetic factors that can inform precision medicine. A major focus of our research is the development of genomics-driven precision health strategies for the Indian population."

        title: "Polygenic Risk Scores",
        tagline: "GWAS, Risk prediction, Patient stratification",
        paragraphs: [
          "Common complex diseases arise through the combined influence of genetic and environmental factors. Unlike Mendelian disorders, their genetic architecture is highly polygenic, with disease risk determined by the cumulative effects of numerous common genetic variants, each contributing a small effect. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genomic loci associated with these complex diseases, providing valuable insights into their genetic basis.",
          "Recent advances have led to the development of polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are calculated using GWAS summary statistics. These scores can be applied to independent cohorts that were not included in the original GWAS, enabling the estimation of an individual\u2019s genetic predisposition to disease. PRS derived from disease-associated GWAS are increasingly becoming valuable for prediction of future disease risk. However, PRS developed using predominantly European ancestry datasets often demonstrate reduced predictive performance in other populations. The emergence of multi-ancestry GWAS has improved the transferability and predictive accuracy of PRS across diverse populations, although important challenges remain.",
          "Beyond disease risk prediction, PRS have broader applications in understanding disease biology. The polygenic architecture of complex diseases can be partitioned into genetic risk components associated with specific biological pathways or processes, resulting in partitioned PRS. Unlike genome-wide PRS, this can help in identifying biologically distinct disease subtypes and enable patient stratification, thereby guiding therapeutic decision-making.",
          "Our research group is broadly interested in applying PRS methodologies for the Indian population. By leveraging diverse genomic datasets and population-specific analyses, we aim to improve disease risk prediction, characterize disease heterogeneity, and advance the implementation of precision medicine in India."

        title: "Rare Variants in Disease",
        tagline: "High-impact coding variants, rare variants - polygenic interaction, target discovery",
        paragraphs: [
          "Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been highly successful in identifying common variants with small effect sizes across the genome, translating these associations into therapeutic interventions for complex diseases remains challenging. This is largely due to the large number of associated loci, the predominance of non-coding variants, and the difficulty of pinpointing causal genes and biological mechanisms. Consequently, the discovery of high-impact rare variants within protein-coding regions continues to provide some of the most actionable insights into disease biology.",
          "Despite their low population frequencies, rare variants collectively outnumber common variants within an individual\u2019s genome. Understanding the functional consequences of these variants is therefore essential for deciphering the genetic basis of disease at the individual level. Recent large-scale biobank studies have provided compelling evidence that common and rare genetic variants often converge on the same causal genes, highlighting complementary mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility. Furthermore, although population genetic models traditionally classify diseases as either monogenic or polygenic, this distinction is increasingly recognized as an oversimplification at the individual level. For a given disease, an individual may carry predominantly polygenic risk, a pathogenic rare variant with a large effect, or a combination of both.",
          "A well-established example is provided by lipid metabolism, where rare protein-coding variants in PCSK9 and LDLR have large effects on circulating lipid levels and familial hypercholesterolemia, while common non-coding variants in the same genes contribute to polygenic risk. Similarly, analyses of the UK Biobank have demonstrated that although polygenic burden explains much of the variation across the population, rare variants account for a disproportionately greater share of heritability at the extremes of quantitative traits and frequently explain phenotypic discordance among siblings. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that interactions between rare variants and polygenic risk can influence disease age of onset, severity, clinical progression, and therapeutic response.",
          "Our research group is particularly interested in identifying rare genetic variants underlying complex diseases in the Indian population and investigating how these variants interact with polygenic risk factors to shape disease susceptibility and clinical outcomes. By integrating rare variant discovery with polygenic risk modelling, we aim to better understand the genetic architecture of complex diseases and contribute to the development of precision medicine strategies tailored to Indian populations."

          "Genetic variants exert their biological effects through changes in molecular phenotypes, including gene expression, protein abundance, and metabolite levels. Consequently, our research group is interested in integrating multiple functional omics modalities \u2014 including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics \u2014 with genomic data to better understand the molecular mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease.",
          "By combining genomic and multi-omics datasets, we aim to identify causal pathways, characterize disease biology, and uncover biomarkers and therapeutic targets for complex diseases. A particular focus of our research is the identification and characterization of molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs), such as expression QTLs (eQTLs), protein QTLs (pQTLs), and metabolite QTLs (mQTLs), in disease-relevant tissues and populations.",
          "Through these efforts, we seek to generate population-specific functional genomic resources and deepen our understanding of the molecular architecture of complex diseases in the Indian population."
